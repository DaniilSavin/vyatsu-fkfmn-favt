EE 4524:

A Lisp book is available on the Web.
The book is Common Lisp:  The Language, 2nd Ed., by Guy Steele,
and it is supposed to be complete.  (This is the same textbook
that the library is trying to put on reserve for us.)

The url is http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/clm.html.
From there, click on Contents, and then select the section you wish to read.
For example, section 6.2.2 describes the predicates that we discussed
in class this morning.  Unfortunately, I have not found a Lisp tutorial 
in this book.

I suggest that you use my class transpariencies as a tutorial introducion;
refer to Steele's book when you need more specifics
concerning the Common Lisp language; then refer to the xlisp manual
when you need help specific to our Lisp interpreter.

Happy LISPing!
