       INFORMATION ABOUT XLISP 2.1G, MICROSOFT WINDOWS VERSIONGENERAL INFORMATION        XLISPWIN,  XLISP 2.1G for Windows, is intended to be a Windows        version of the MSDOS  program,  and  therefore  has  the  same        general  feel.   Some  aspects of its use do not match typical        Windows applications, and XLISPWIN applications  do  not  have        any  access  to  the Windows API.  I will leave that to future        developers.SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS        Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The  executable  provided  also        requires an 80386, however "enhanced" mode of operation is not        required.   XLISPWIN  is  memory  efficient,  however   memory        requirements  are  a  function  of your application.  XLISPWIN        will use as much memory as it need for the application.        The font utilized will virtually require the use of an 800x600        pixel display or larger ("Super-VGA"). 640x480 is slightly too        small.  To adjust the font size, see the last section in  this        file.BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS        XLISPWIN  has been tested with Borland C++, Version 4.0. Other        compilers will probably require changes.  Future  versions  of        Windows  or  Windows  NT native versions will almost certainly        require changes.  Particularly watch out for  the  MALLOC  and        FREE  macros  defined  in  xlisp.h.  The dldmem/dlimage memory        management option must be used.  The winstuff.c file  contains        most   of  the  system  changes,  but  if  you  want  to  make        alterations, you need to study xlisp.h  as  well.   The  files        xlispwin.def,   xlispwin.rc,   xlispwin.ico,   xlispwin.h  and        makewin are used for this version.IMPLEMENTATION FEATURES        XLISPWIN has been designed to be "Windows friendly."  In  that        regard, it:        * regularly yields control to other Windows processes        * does not use processor cycles when idle (waiting for input)        * closes all files when idle        * allocates memory in ~64k chunks to preserve memory handles        XLISPWIN  can be compiled for either the ASCII8 (IBM-PC ASCII)        or ANSI character sets, with the  distribution  default  being        ANSI.   For  full  source  file  compatibility  with  the  DOS        versions, the ASCII8 version might be  preferred.   This  only        affects the high-bit set characters.MISSING FEATURES (COMPARED TO MS-DOS VERSION)        While  all command line arguments function, standard input and        output cannot be redirected from the command line.   But  then        it  is  difficult to access the Windows "command line" anyway!        However a  default  set  of  command  line  arguments  can  be        specified in XLISPWIN.INI.        All  the keyboard and display functions match those of the DOS        version.  The display size cannot be  changed  while  running,        which  disallows  full-screen operation.  The display size can        be changed via a XLISPWIN.INI file.        The system function returns immediately, spawning  a  separate        application  window.  Both Windows and DOS applications can be        launched,  and  the  program  filename   extension   must   be        specified.ADDED FEATURES TO THE USER INTERFACE        Unlike  the  DOS  version, the color changing applies to text.        The COLOR function takes 1, 3, or 6  integer  arguments,  with        the  one  argument  version  being  like  the  MS-DOS version,        however the bit positions 256, 64, 32, 16 (notice the gap  for        the  intensity bit so it doesn't overlap with XOR) specify the        background text color,  which  is  also  the  screen  clearing        color.   This  means  that  "compatible"  programs will end up        using a black background.  Compatible programs should also set        (color  15)  before  writing text.  The exclusive or bit (128)        sets exclusive or mode, just like the MS-DOS version.        When three arguments are specified,  the  represent  the  red,        green,  and blue intensity levels, respectively, in a range of        0-255. Add a red value 256 to get xor mode (like  in  the  one        arg case).        When  six  arguments  are  provided,  the  last  three set the        background color.  XLISP-PLUS does not realize palettes so  is        limited  to 16 colors.  Feel free to change the source if this        is important to you!  The MODE command is ignored,  but  (like        the  DOS  version)  returns the display size in characters and        the maximum pixel coordinates).        I wish to point out that if the XLISP window is obscured,  and        then uncovered, graphics will not be redrawn, and the original        color choices won't be maintained.  That's caused  by  me  not        maintaining this information or saving the bitmap.        The cursor ("caret") shows matching parenthesis and quotes.        The  mouse  cursor  changes  shape to hourglass or garbage bag        (for garbage collection) while executing.  This  doesn't  work        as smoothly as I had hoped.  Don't tell me about it unless you        can offer a solution.        The "Drag and Drop" feature of the File Manager is supported.        Popup dialog boxes are used  for  fatal  errors.        Exiting via the Files menu or system  menu  (or  ALT-F4)  will        cause  a  prompt allowing saving the workspace before leaving.        The (EXIT) function will bypass this prompt.   Control-Z  will        no  longer  cause  the program to exit, and now behaves like a        silent version of control-G.        Files menu: allows menu activiation of  LOAD,  RESTORE,  SAVE,        DRIBBLE,  and  EXIT  commands.   The standard dialog boxes are        used for the file accessing commands.  The  last  file  LOADed        via  the  menu  is remembered, as is the last file DRIBBLEd by        the menu, or the last  workspace  saved  or  restored  by  any        means.   The  EXIT  command can be executed at any time, while        the other commands can  only  be  executed  when  XLISPWIN  is        waiting  for  input  --  this is to protect against mysterious        interactions since there is only a single execution thread.        The SAVE and DRIBBLE commands preserve  line  currently  being        edited, while the LOAD and RESTORE commands delete the current        line (figuring you won't what anything typed).        Edit menu: The copy command copies a rectangular region to the        clipboard,  and  pastes at the cursor position.  That means it        works effectively like the the commands do in  a  DOS  window,        however   they   are   activated   with  the  typical  Windows        keystrokes.  Drag with the left mouse  button  to  select  the        region.   Hitting any key (without doing the copy) will delete        the region.        Run menu: Allow menu operation of the keyboard control-B,  -G,        -C, and -P commands.  Also toggles the status window, which is        automatically updated once a second.   Inappropriate  commands        are grayed out.        Help  menu:  There  is  no  additional  help,  but there is an        "About" selection.XLISPWIN.INI        A file of this name can be placed in the Windows directory  to        control  the font, number of lines, and other characteristics.        Only fixed width fonts (such as "Courier New", "Fixedsys",  or        "Lucinda  Sans  Typewriter"  (from the Microsoft Truetype Font        Pack I)) should be used for best results.  Font  sizes  should        be  in  the  10-20  point  range.  The Fixedsys font cannot be        scaled.  You can also specify the number of lines.   When  the        OEM (PC-8) character set is selected, only the number of lines        can be changed.  In addition the leading between the lines can        be  adjusted via a "Leading" entry.  This may be desirable for        fonts other than  FixedSys  which  seem  to  insert  too  much        leading.  The default leading is what Windows suggests for the        font, and negative values are allowed.        The entry "Arglist" can be used to specify a default  argument        list  to,  for  instance, load a certain workspace file.  When        missing, the actual argument list is used.        The entry "FilePath" specifies an an alterative search path to        the environment variable XLPATH.  The path should be specified        in quotes so the semicolon separators  are  not  take  as  the        start  of  the  comments.   When  this  entry  is missing, the        environment  variable  is  used.   This  allow  specifying   a        different path for the Windows version.        There  is  only one section in the XLISPWIN.INI file; the line        "[Xlisp]" must be the first line in the file.        The default file contents are:        [Xlisp]        FilePath="[the contents of the XLPATH environment variable]"        Arglist="[the command line arguments]"        Lines=25        Font="Fixedsys"        FontSize=16	Leading=[Window's default for the font]        I happen to like:        [Xlisp]        FontSize=14        Lines=30        Font="Courier New Bold"        Leading=-1*END*
